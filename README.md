# SlingShotBasic

In my game, I went with a fire/ice motif, making the main target for my slingshooter. I built everything in Unity.

I made a parallax background (Background Parallax Script), using script and some basic drawings. It does not work perfectly, I believe due to the FollowCam Script.

I also added a component onto the Projectile, which was a small script that makes it so the 'SnowMan' is destroyed when hit by the Projectile.

I also made a few basic materials for all of the elements in my game.

Thank you!
